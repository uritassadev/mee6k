# MEE6K Box - Phase 2 Complete

## 🚀 Phase 2: Runtime Guardian & Vulnerability Scanner

Phase 2 of the MEE6K Box security platform adds two critical security components:

### 🛡️ Runtime Guardian (Port 8081)
- Real-time container monitoring based on Falco patterns
- Security event detection with custom policies
- Process and file access monitoring
- Policy management with severity levels
- Message queue integration for alerts

### 🔍 Vulnerability Scanner (Port 8082)
- Container image scanning based on Trivy patterns
- CVE database integration with detailed reports
- Automated periodic scanning
- Vulnerability management with CVSS scores
- Scan result publishing via message queue

## 📊 Architecture

```
MEE6K Box Platform
├── API Gateway (8080)     ✅ Phase 1
├── Runtime Guardian (8081) ✅ Phase 2  
├── Vuln Scanner (8082)    ✅ Phase 2
├── PostgreSQL (5432)      ✅ Infrastructure
├── Redis (6379)           ✅ Infrastructure  
└── RabbitMQ (5672/15672)  ✅ Infrastructure
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Start all services including Phase 2
./start.sh

# Test all endpoints including new services
./test-api.sh
```

## 📚 New Endpoints

### Runtime Guardian
- `/health` - Service health check
- `/api/v1/events` - Security events
- `/api/v1/policies` - Security policies
- `/api/v1/status` - Service status

### Vulnerability Scanner
- `/health` - Service health check
- `/api/v1/scans` - Scan results
- `/api/v1/scan/:id` - Detailed scan result
- `/api/v1/vulnerabilities` - Vulnerability database
- `/api/v1/status` - Service status

## 🔄 Integration

Both services integrate with the existing platform:
- Communication via RabbitMQ message queue
- API Gateway integration for centralized management
- Docker socket access for container monitoring
- Shared security event format

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Implement alert correlation between runtime events and vulnerabilities
2. Add custom security policies for specific threats
3. Integrate with external security tools
4. Develop dashboard for visualization
